                Hello World, i am Keith Owino based at Nairobi, Kenya.
            </p><br>
            <p>The Journey</p><br>
            <p>
                When I discovered web design in Highschool, I realized it would be the perfect fit. I have been working as 
                an Independent Frontend Web Developer since 2018. I work at the intersection of human empathy, curiosity, 
                reasoning, intelligent data and imagination, which guide me to uncover insights, (re)frame problems and craft 
                meaningful, future-oriented solutions. I am passionate about providing solutions that would satisfy users by 
                building accessible products.
            </p><br>
            <p>What can a “frontend web developer” do, you ask?</p><br>
            <p>
                I do not use tricks or magic but facts. I can develop a website from nothing into existence, fully formed.  
                I have specialized in manipulating the very fabric of the web, it's raw materials HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
                Certificates are certain. My art & design background informs ideation to design to implementation. A software
                developer knows no bounds. And when they find one they cross it without hesitation, boldly going into
                the unknown to return even more learned.            
            </p><br>
            <p>
